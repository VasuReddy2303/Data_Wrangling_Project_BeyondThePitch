### Data Source Description:
##### 1) The data is available in CSV format, making it easily accessible and compatible for analysis.
##### 2) To import the data into a pandas DataFrame, the built-in method "read_csv" can be utilized, streamlining the process and facilitating efficient data manipulation.


```{python}
###### CODE Snippet #######

# The data is accessible via the following link, formatted as comma-separated values (CSV): "https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php"
# Import and use pandas to input the data and transform in to a pandas dataframe.

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(r'https://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2324/E0.csv')

# Using the r prefix before a string literal in Python (e.g., r'string') indicates a raw string, which treats backslashes \ as literal characters rather than interpreting them as escape sequences

df.head()
# len(df.columns)
```

### Some more information on importing the dataset.
##### 1. Each CSV file contains data for an entire season
##### 2. The data from each of the last 10 seasons will be extracted as required for analysis purpose
##### 3. Each season comprises a distinct dataset, necessitating the extraction and subsequent merging of each dataset into a comprehensive cumulative dataset.

---

### Here are the steps for importing the data and creating a final DataFrame without the specific code:

##### 1. **Import Data Individually:**
   - Use the provided link to access and download each season's data as separate CSV files.

##### 2. **Create a Base DataFrame:**
   - Start with an empty DataFrame that will act as the base DataFrame for merging.

##### 3. **Merge Imported Datasets:**
   - As you download each season's data, merge it into the base DataFrame. Use the appropriate merging technique (e.g., concatenation) to combine the data from different seasons into a single DataFrame.

##### 4. **Final DataFrame:**
   - Once all seasons' data is merged into the base DataFrame, you will have a final DataFrame that comprises data from all seasons. This final DataFrame will be ready for analysis and further processing.

By following these steps, we can effectively import, merge, and create a comprehensive DataFrame containing data from all seasons for your analysis needs.
